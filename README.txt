Skill dig is an interactive resume.
Install node on your system, and run the application using "node app.js". You can visit the site at localhost:3000.
Upload your file, using the upload button. For future development, this file will be retrieved from the "uploads" folder, to perform natural language processing, and return the "matching" skills requested by an employer.
The aim of the project is to connect employers to jobseekers, to better automate the job-description-matching process.
